# US Public Transportation Analysis: Financial, Operational, Environmental Aspects

## Executive Summary:
The public transportation industry has been experiencing drastic external changes in the past few decades. With the heightened emphasis being placed on green energy by society, the rapid emergence of ride-sharing services, as well as the unexpected advent of COVID-19, the U.S. public transportation system is experiencing pressure to successfully adjust. The purpose of this project is to analyze the financial, operational, and environmental factors that should be of particular note, in order to successfully transition the public transportation system into the new world.

## Business Case:
The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) is aware of the rapid change in the climate of transportation in recent years. With rising costs, and heightened awareness of green energy and health and safety due to the entrance of COVID-19, APTA is undertaking a grand effort to identify key cost drivers (financially / environmentally) and new opportunities to adjust the public transportation system to be more effective and efficient. By using the provided data source and analyzing the trends in capital and operating expenditures, revenue & funding sources, as well as energy consumption details, we will provide a clearer picture of any current inefficiencies and opportunities that APTA could alleviate / exercise.
